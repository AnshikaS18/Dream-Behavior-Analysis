# Dream Behavior & Emotional Analysis

This project analyzes dream records to understand how stress levels,
sleep stages, and emotional states influence dream sentiment and behavior.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project was self-generated through web scraping.
Dream entries were collected from publicly available online sources such as
Reddit discussion threads and online dream journal websites.

The raw data was cleaned, structured, and transformed into an analysis-ready
format before being stored in a MySQL database.

No personally identifiable information was collected or retained.

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL
- Python
- Power BI

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize emotional,
behavioral, and sleep-related patterns in dream data.

### Dashboard Highlights
- KPI overview showing total dreams, average sentiment, stress levels, and lucid dream percentage
- Emotion-wise distribution of dreams and emotional polarity
- Analysis of emotional intensity across different sleep stages
- Relationship between stress before sleep and dream sentiment
- Comparison of dream length with emotional polarity

The dashboard includes interactive filters for emotion, sleep stage,
season, and lucid dreaming to allow dynamic exploration of insights.
